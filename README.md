Work Breakdown:

Bryan Veres: Bryan focused on environment design, creating the expansive Martian landscapes. On top of that, Bryan implemented the very-important key card feature, game's physics and special effects. In addition, Bryan found the soundtracks that match the theme of the game. 
Sichang Su: Sichang came up with the story of the game. Since Sichang came up with the story, he then also developed the main character and modify the weapons and enemies to fit the theme of the game. Besides that, Sichang also modify the main menu, adding section "Background Story". Eventually, when the project is finished, Sichang tested the gameplay loop and make a demo video.
